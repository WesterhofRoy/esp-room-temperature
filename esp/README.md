# ESP32

The esp32 is used to collect the inside temperature, and send this to the Server.

## Frameworks

The code is compiled and uploaded to the ESP using [Platform.io](https://platformio.org/). Platformio has extensive support and documentation on how to get started.

## Setting up env vars.

Change the constants on [L-13,14,15](https://github.com/WesterhofRoy/esp-room-temperature/blob/main/esp/src/main.cpp#L13) to reflect your environment
